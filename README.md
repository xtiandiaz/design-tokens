# Design Tokens ðŸŽ¨

A utility to read and export colors, text styles, and more, from a Figma file.

For now, it is only aimed at the Web platform. Feel free to fork and extend to your needs.

## Setup

1. Install the NPM project as usual.
1. Create an `.env` file containing your `FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN`.
1. At `figma.ts`, update the `fileId` with the ID of the Figma file containing your own tokens. For reference, check the [source file](https://www.figma.com/design/bINVy3ZxKbDUh4Hs1PijwI/Design-Tokens) alongside the code at `figma.ts` to grasp how the Figma file is assembled and read in code using their API. Then, proceed to adapt your own file and code to your preferences.
1. Excecute `npm run build` to read the Figma file and build the tokens, by extracting data and generating them in the form of assets.

# Web Design Tokens

These are my only focus nowadays, and will keep on refining them and adding more as I progress in parallel with apps built on Vue. These Web Design Tokens include:
1. A `_color.scss` partial sheet with colors categorized and ready to use on both color schemes (light and dark).
1. A `_typography.scss` partial sheet with text styles; all of their attributes declared either within element or class selectors. Moreover, their font faces declared and their corresponding files copied and stored as assets.
1. Other partial sheets, mixins, and utilities written in SCSS.
1. Custom icons exported as SVGs and as an icon font (WIP).
